# Math Functions

This is a simple collection of several math functions programmed on the C Programming Language. Specifically, this has been programmed on C89 / C90, also commonly known as ANSI C.

This was written mostly to practice writing C code, but also provides useful functions that may be useful to some.

## Functions

### Primality Test
This function will determine if any given number is a prime number or not.

### Prime Factorization
This function will give the prime factorization of any given number.

### Nth Term in Fibonacci Sequence
This function will return any desired term in the fibonacci sequence.

### Convert a Number from any Base to any Base
This function will allow the user to convert a number in any base to any other base.

### Greatest Common Divisor
This function will return the greatest common divisor of any given number.

## Compiling

This program comes with a Makefile that uses GCC to compile Simply run `make` on the Makefile and it will compile an executable which can then be used to run any of the functions listed above.

## Testing
This program will soon come with a test suite to demonstrate the correctness of each function. This section will be updated once it is added.
